                       Explainable AI (XAI)
Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that promotes a set of tools,
techniques, and algorithms that can generate high-quality interpretable, human-understandable explanations of AI decisions.
Even when we understand the underlying mathematics of current machine learning architectures, it is often impossible to get
insight into the internal working of the models; we need explicit modelling and reasoning tools to explain how and why a 
result was achieved. Explainability is one of the most important features, it is the process of understanding how and why
the Machine Learning Model making a prediction. It can also help in validation of Model, robustness and accuracy.
